## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** [Option X - Approach/Library Name]

**Rationale:**

[Provide clear explanation of why this option was selected. Reference the comparison matrix and decision drivers.]

We chose [Option X] because:

1. **[Primary Reason]** - [Detailed explanation, e.g., "Synchronous API is simpler for library consumers and avoids async complexity"]
2. **[Secondary Reason]** - [Detailed explanation, e.g., "Performance is sufficient for local file operations, can add async later if needed"]
3. **[Additional Reason]** - [Detailed explanation, e.g., "Smaller binary size and faster compile times without async runtime"]

**Trade-offs Accepted:**

- [Trade-off 1, e.g., "Less efficient for network I/O (S3), but local files are primary use case initially"]
- [Trade-off 2, e.g., "Cannot easily parallelize operations, but most workflows are single-threaded anyway"]
- [Trade-off 3, e.g., "May need to add async version later for cloud operations"]

---

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- [Benefit 1, e.g., "Simpler API for library consumers - no async/await needed"]
- [Benefit 2, e.g., "Smaller binary size and faster compile times"]
- [Benefit 3, e.g., "Easier to test and debug without async complexity"]
- [Benefit 4, e.g., "Works seamlessly with non-async codebases"]

### Negative Consequences

- [Challenge 1, e.g., "Inefficient for concurrent network operations"]
- [Challenge 2, e.g., "May need breaking change later to add async support"]
- [Challenge 3, e.g., "Cannot take advantage of async ecosystem (tokio, etc.)"]

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| [Risk 1, e.g., "Performance insufficient for cloud storage"] | Medium | Medium | [Mitigation, e.g., "Benchmark early, add async API if needed"] |
| [Risk 2, e.g., "Breaking change needed later"] | High | Medium | [Mitigation, e.g., "Design API to allow async version alongside sync"] |
| [Risk 3, e.g., "Dependency becomes unmaintained"] | Medium | Low | [Mitigation, e.g., "Monitor crate health, have fallback plan"] |

## Implementation Notes

### Migration Path

[If replacing existing implementation, describe migration approach]

- **Phase 1:** [e.g., "Implement new API in parallel module"]
- **Phase 2:** [e.g., "Migrate tests to use new API"]

- **Phase 4:** [e.g., "Remove old implementation in next major version"]

### Code Changes Required

- [Change 1, e.g., "Update Cargo.toml dependencies"]
- [Change 2, e.g., "Refactor zarr module to use new approach"]
- [Change 3, e.g., "Update public API exports in lib.rs"]
- [Change 4, e.g., "Update CLI commands to use new API"]

### Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update rustdoc comments
- [ ] Add migration guide for library users (if breaking change)
- [ ] Update README examples
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG
- [ ] Add code examples in examples/ directory

### Testing Strategy

- [ ] Write unit tests for new implementation
- [ ] Write integration tests

### Rollback Plan

[How to revert if this doesn't work out]

- Keep old implementation behind feature flag initially
- If issues arise, can re-enable old code path
- Document known limitations upfront to avoid surprises
